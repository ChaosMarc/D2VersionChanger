\pard\li360 This program is an mpq archiver I \f1 started\f0  as an example of a program using the Mpq Control\f1 , but it now uses SFmpq directly\f0 .  It currently has many features and is one of the best mpq archivers around.\par

\ul\b\fs24 Mo'PaQ 2000 parameters and scripts in WinMPQ\ulnone\b0\fs20\par
\pard\li360 WinMPQ has support for running Mo'PaQ 2000 (MPQ2k) parameters and scripts; it almost has full support for every parameter MPQ2k uses and has commands and additional features MPQ2k doesn't have.  Also, the name of the MPQ archive only needs to be specified when opening files and using command-line parameters.  (parts of this section are taken from the Mo'PaQ 2000 manual)\par
\par
\pard\ul General syntax:\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 Filenames containing spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks like this:\par
\par
\f2 "filename with spaces"\f0\par
\pard\par
\ul Adding Files - the \b\i Add\b0\i0  Command\par
\ulnone\tab The syntax for adding files is:\par
\ul\par
\pard\li720\ulnone\f2 a[dd] <MPQFile> <SourceFile> [DestinationFile] [/c] [/wav] [/auto] [/r]\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 Parameters in <> are required, ones in [] are optional.  MPQFile is the MoPaQ to add the file(s) to.  SourceFile is the file(s) to add to the MoPaQ.  If there is only a single file being added (no wildcards are used), DestinationFile is the name that the file will be stored as in the MoPaQ.  But, if there are multiple files to add (wildcards are used), DestinationFile is the \i directory\i0  to put the files in.  /c tells WinMPQ to compress the file(s).  /wav tells WinMPQ to add the file with WAV compression, which is recommended for .WAV files (if both /c and /wav are used, /c will be ignored and /wav used).  /auto tells WinMPQ to automatically select the appropriate compression option for each file (if any other compression options are used, they will override this).  /r tells WinMPQ to recurse through subdirectories when searching for files to add.  If no DestinationFile is given, the file will be added with the same name as SourceFile.\par
\par
Wildcard characters (* and ?) are used by many command-line programs to represent multiple files.  WinMPQ uses them currently only for the \b\i Add\b0\i0  command.  Wildcards represent one or more unknown characters.  The ? wildcard stands for a single unknown character, while * wildcards stand for any number of unknown characters.\cf0\par
\pard\par
\ul Extracting Files - the \b\i Extract\b0\i0  Command\par
\pard\li720\cf1\ulnone The syntax for the extract command is:\par
\par
\f2 e[xtract] <MPQFile> <SourceFile> [DestinationDirectory] [/fp]\cf0\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 The parameters in <> are required, ones in [] are optional.  SourceFile is the FULL name of the file(s) to be extracted from the MoPaQ, and DestinationDirectory is the directory in which to put the extracted file(s).  If DestinationDirectory is absent, the file will be placed in the current directory.  Wildcards may be used in SourceFile.  The /r parameter MPQ2K uses currently isn't supported by WinMPQ.  The /fp parameter specifies that WinMPQ should extract the files with the full path.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul Renaming Files - the \b\i Rename\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for the rename command is:\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1\f2 r[ename] <MPQFile> <OldFileName> <NewFileName>\cf0\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 All parameters are required.  OldFileName is the full filename of the file to be renamed, and NewFileName is the new name for the file.  If wildcards are used with the rename command, they must be used for both OldFileName and NewFileName.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul Moving Files - the \b\i Move\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720\cf1 The move command moves one or more files from one virtual directory (technically MoPaQs don't have directories like hard drives do) to another virtual directory. The syntax is as shown:\par
\pard\cf0\par
\pard\li720\cf1\f2 m[ove] <MPQFile> <SourceFile> <DestinationDirectory>\cf0\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 All parameters are required.  SourceFile is the file(s) to be moved (wildcards allowed), DestinationDirectory is the virtual directory the file(s) to be moved will be placed in.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul Deleting Files - the \b\i Delete\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for the delete file command is:\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1\f2 d[elete] <MPQFile> <FileToDelete>\cf0\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 All parameters are required.  FileToDelete is just that, the file(s) to delete.  Wildcards may be used in FileToDelete.  /r can't be used with this command in WinMPQ.\par
The first time you use the delete command, you might be rather surprised to find that a deleted file rarely takes up less space in a MoPaQ than a file that hasn't been deleted!  This is due to the fact that the delete command only marks a file as deleted; it doesn't actually remove the file from the archive (to preempt the next question, no, you can't undelete a deleted file).  To actually remove the file from the MoPaQ, you must use the flush command.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul Flushing Out an Archive - the \b\i Flush\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for the flush command is:\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1\f2 f[lush] <MPQFile>\cf0\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 MPQFile is the file to flush.\par
The flush command searches through a MoPaQ and purges the space deleted files occupy, shrinking the MoPaQ's size if there are any deleted files in it.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul Listing the Files in an Archive - the \b\i List\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for the list files command is:\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1\f2 l[ist] <MPQFile> [Filter] <Out_File>\cf0\f0\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1 The parameters in <> are required, ones in [] are optional.  This will list all the files in the MoPaQ to a text file.  The [Filter] parameter is a wildcard filter that specifies what files to list.  The <Out_File> parameter tells WinMPQ the file to write the listing to.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul Running Scripts - the \b\i Script\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 To run a script:\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\cf1\f2 s[cript] <ScriptFile>\f0\par
\pard\cf0\par
\ul\b\fs24 Writing Scripts\ulnone\b0\fs20\par
\pard\li360\cf1 A script is basically a file that contains a lot of command lines for WinMPQ to process.  This allows you to compile one or more entire MoPaQs in a single process.\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\ul Differences Between the Command Line and Scripts\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 For simplicity's sake, the command-line and script-line syntax are almost identical.  There are a couple major points of difference, though.\par
\par
1.\tab MoPaQs must be explicitly opened in scripts.\par
2.\tab Because of this, you don't need to specify which MoPaQ you are working with on every single line, as you did on the command-line.\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\ul Opening Archives - the \b\i Open\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The very first thing you must do in scripts is to open the MoPaQ you want to work with.  The general syntax for the 'open archive' command is:\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\li720\f2 o[pen] <MPQFile> [FileLimit]\par
\pard\li1440\f0\par
\pard\li720 Parameters in <> are required, ones in [] are optional. MPQFile is the file to open.  FileLimit only takes affect when the archive is being created from scratch.  It is the maximum number of files that this archive can hold, and is 1024 by default.  If the MoPaQ already exists, FileLimit will have no effect, but no warning will be indicated.  The FileLimit parameter has a minimum value of 16, and a maximum value of 262144.\par
NOTE: Each file that a MoPaQ can hold (the FileLimit) takes up 16 bytes in the MoPaQ, regardless of whether or not it is used.  This can add up.  For example, an empty MoPaQ with a file limit of 262144 would be 4 MB large!\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\ul New Archives - the \b\i New\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The general syntax for the 'new archive' command is:\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\li720\f2 n[ew] <MPQFile> [FileLimit]\par
\pard\li1440\f0\par
\pard\li720 Parameters in <> are required, ones in [] are optional.  MPQFile is the file to open.  This command will force WinMPQ to overwrite the archive and create a new one.\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\ul Closing Archives - the \b\i Close\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 MPQ2k requires this, but using it in WinMPQ isn't required.  It is very simple to use the close command, as shown on the following line:\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\li720\f2 c[lose]\f0\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\ul Script Comments - the Semicolon \b\i ;\ulnone\b0\i0\par
\pard\li720 On some occasions you may want to put comments in a script file for one reason or another.  To do this, simply put a semicolon(;) as the first character on a line, and the line will be ignored, and no error will be signaled.\par
\pard\cf0\par
\cf1\ul Changing the Current Directory - the \b\i CD\b0\i0  or \b\i CHDIR\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for this command is:\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\li720\f2 cd <NewDirectory>\par
\pard\li1440\f0\par
\pard\li720 Parameters in <> are required.  NewDirectory is the directory the command will go to.  Use "\f2 ..\f0 " to go to the parent directory.\par
\par
\pard\ul Changing the Current Drive - the \i X\b :\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for this command is:\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\li720\f2 <DriveLetter>:\par
\pard\li1440\f0\par
\pard\li720 Parameters in <> are required.  DriveLetter is the letter of the drive you want to switch to.\par
\par
\pard\ul Closing WinMPQ - the \b\i Exit\b0\i0  or \b\i Quit\b0\i0  Command\ulnone\par
\pard\li720 The syntax for this command is:\par
\pard\li1440\par
\pard\li720\f2 x\par
\pard\li360\f0 or\f2\par
\pard\li720 exit\par
\pard\li360\f0 or\f2\par
\pard\li720 quit\par
\pard\li1440\f0\par
\pard\li720 This command closes WinMPQ.\par
\par
\pard\cf0\ul\b\fs24 The MPQ2k Command Box\ulnone\b0\fs20\par
\pard\li360\cf1 This is a text box where you can type in different commands.  The commands are the same as they are in the script files, but there are a few differences.  The \b\i Open\b0\i0  command can be used to open an archive into the main listing in addition to using the open menu command.  It can also be used by itself to reload an archive.  Just like with scripts, you don't need to specify the name of the archive for commands other than the open command.  All commands typed into the box affect the archive open in the main listing.\par
\par
\pard\cf0\ul\b\fs24 Locale ID\ulnone\b0\fs20\par
\pard\li360 The locale ID determines what language\f1  version of the software\f0  a file is\f1  intended for\f0 .  Here is a list of some of the ID numbers you can use \f1 for\f0  files.\par
\pard\par
\pard\li720\tx3600 0\tab Language Neutral/English\par
1031 (407 in hex)\tab German\par
1033 (409 in hex)\tab English (neutral is usually used instead of this)\par
1034 (40A in hex)\tab Spanish\par
1036 (40C in hex)\tab French\par
1040 (410 in hex)\tab Italian\par
1046 (416 in hex)\tab Portuguese\par
\pard\par
\ul\b\fs24 Version notes\ulnone\b0\fs20\par
\pard\li360 The menu option for running Mo'PaQ 2000 scripts has support for almost everything.  The /r switch may only be used with Add, and the /lf and /p switches are not used with the List command because WinMPQ does not display the list to the screen.  Scripts can be run within each other in WinMPQ.  Use the /auto parameter with the Add command to use compression auto-selection.\par
