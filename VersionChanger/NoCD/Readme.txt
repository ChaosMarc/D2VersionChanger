Diablo II Classic + Lord of Destruction : No CD Pack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This pack contains a modified "Game.exe" for every patch, pre-1.12. They
have been decrypted and SecuRom has been removed. This will allow older
versions of the game to run without the CD. The files included should be
identical to the way they were before being protected by SecuRom. Feel
free to use them for playing or modifying older patches. They may be ran
in a debugger.

There are two directories, "Classic" and "Expansion". Simply copy the file
"Game.exe" from the corresponding version into the "Diablo II" directory.
There isn't any need to backup the old file as patches still work.

Note that there isn't a version included for 1.04 and 1.09c. These patches
were only available for a very short time and neither can be downloaded.

Also note the "Battle.net Beta" version included for both Classic and the
Expansion. These will let you run the patches installed by the Battle.net
Beta without the CD (beta patches 1.02 and 1.41 respectively).
